	Perhaps the greatest influence of dog philosophy is in the areas of social and clinical psychology. The canine philosophers say that it is okay to thrive on attention and to let people touch you. They also have reached the conclusion that if someone is having a bad day the best therapy is to simply be silent and to sit close by them. If you don't know what to say, say nothing. If you do know what to say, say nothing. In both cases it is therapeutic to nuzzle them gently.
